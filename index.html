			<p class = "interestingFact">Green iguanas have a third eye. This retina-like structure is located on the top of the head and it is connected with a pineal gland in the brain. Although it does not produce images like a regular eye, it reacts to the changes in light and it is used for detection of predators above the head.</p>

			<p>Primarily herbivores, iguanas are active during the day, feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruit. They generally live near water and are excellent swimmers. If threatened, they will leap from a branch, often from great heights, and escape with a splash to the water below. They are also tough enough to land on solid ground from as high as 40 feet and survive.</p>
